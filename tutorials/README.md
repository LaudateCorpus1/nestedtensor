# Tutorials

All the tutorials above are best consumed through colab. It allows you to follow the material and play with it at the same time!

The tutorials are split into five sections.

#### First: [basic](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/nestedtensor/blob/master/tutorials/basic.ipynb)

Throughout this tutorial you'll learn how to construct a NestedTensor from a list of Tensors and it's key properties such as dimension and nested size.

#### Second: [naryops_and_reduce](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/nestedtensor/blob/master/tutorials/naryops_and_reduce.ipynb)

Throughout this tutorial you'll learn how to use NestedTensors together with the usual basic pointwise operations such as addition or cosine.

#### Third: [indexing](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/nestedtensor/blob/master/tutorials/indexing.ipynb)

Throughout this tutorial you'll learn how to index into and slice NestedTensors to get the subsets of data you need.

#### Fourth: [models](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/nestedtensor/blob/master/tutorials/models.ipynb)

Throughout this tutorial we'll show how to construct a basic NLP model using nn.EmbeddingBag and use a pretrained resnet from torchvision.

#### Fifth: [text_classification](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/nestedtensor/blob/master/tutorials/text_classification.ipynb)

Throughout this tutorial we'll construct a simple NLP sentiment classifier on top of the DBPedia dataset.
